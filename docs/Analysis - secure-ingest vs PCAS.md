# **Shifting the Security Perimeter in Agentic Networks: A Comparative Analysis of Boundary-Layer Sanitization versus Execution-State Policy Compilation**

## **Abstract**

The accelerated deployment of Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents in high-stakes enterprise environments has exposed unprecedented vulnerabilities in system authorization and data integrity. Modern multi-agent architectures operate in complex, non-linear topologies requiring stringent adherence to dynamic authorization policies, including tiered customer service protocols, multi-stage approval workflows, and rigid regulatory compliance standards for data access. Traditional methods of embedding security constraints directly into system prompts have proven fundamentally insufficient, offering no deterministic enforcement guarantees against adversarial manipulation, prompt injection, and transitive information flow corruption. In response to these vulnerabilities, the early 2026 introduction of the Policy Compiler for Secure Agentic Systems (PCAS) proposed a paradigm shift toward execution-state policy compilation. By modeling multi-agent interactions as causal dependency graphs and enforcing Datalog-derived declarative policies via a compiled reference monitor, PCAS successfully intercepts unauthorized actions prior to execution. However, this late-stage execution intervention leaves the underlying cognitive state of the LLM highly susceptible to context window contamination, while the computational overhead of maintaining global dependency graphs introduces severe latency bottlenecks. This research provides an exhaustive comparative and theoretical analysis between the execution-state architecture of PCAS and the boundary-layer ingestion framework utilized by the secure-ingest repository within the rai-agentic-toolkit. By relocating the primary security perimeter from the execution phase to the point of data ingestion, the boundary-layer approach guarantees cryptographic provenance, heuristic sanitization, and micro-segmented isolation before adversarial payloads can interact with the agent's reasoning engine. Through rigorous mathematical modeling of attack surfaces and computational complexity, this paper demonstrates the theoretical superiority of ingestion-layer defenses. Furthermore, a comprehensive experimental design is proposed to empirically validate the latency advantages, state recovery rates, and zero-day sanitization efficacy of the secure-ingest framework compared to contemporary PCAS techniques.

## **1\. Introduction**

The transition from isolated conversational models to autonomous, multi-agent systems represents a critical inflection point in artificial intelligence infrastructure. These networked agentic systems are increasingly tasked with executing highly sensitive operations across diverse enterprise domains, ranging from automated pharmacovigilance data processing to decentralized financial transaction approvals.1 The fundamental operational requirement for these systems is the capacity to ingest unstructured natural language, parse intent, formulate multi-step execution plans, and interface dynamically with external Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), secure databases, and human-in-the-loop oversight nodes.

As the autonomy of these agents expands, the attack surface scales proportionally, revealing novel vectors for exploitation. Adversaries leverage sophisticated prompt injection techniques, adversarial geometry, and transitive data poisoning to manipulate the information flow across agents, seeking to bypass access restrictions and subvert system-level policies.3 Historically, mitigation strategies relied heavily on embedding authorization constraints within the initial system prompts or utilizing subsequent LLM-based verification layers to monitor outputs.1 These prompt-level interventions provide no formal enforcement guarantees, as the probabilistic nature of transformer-based architectures inherently prevents the deterministic enforcement of logical boundaries.1 Consequently, the industry consensus has rapidly shifted toward the necessity of decoupled, deterministic security architectures capable of enforcing complex access control policies independent of the underlying generative model's reasoning capabilities.3

In February 2026, researchers introduced the Policy Compiler for Secure Agentic Systems (PCAS), establishing a new benchmark for execution-state security.1 The PCAS framework seeks to resolve the inadequacies of linear message histories by constructing a comprehensive dependency graph that captures the causal relationships among tool calls, tool results, and inter-agent messages.1 Administrators define security protocols using a Datalog-derived policy language, which is subsequently compiled into a highly efficient Rust-based reference monitor via Differential Datalog.3 This monitor acts as an absolute gateway, intercepting proposed agent actions and blocking any tool execution that violates the pre-compiled authorization policies.1

While empirical evaluations demonstrate that PCAS significantly enhances operational policy compliance—elevating success rates from 48% to 93% in standardized customer service benchmarks 1—the architecture is constrained by fundamental theoretical limitations. Chief among these is the vulnerability of the agent's internal cognitive state. Because the PCAS reference monitor intervenes only at the point of action execution, malicious payloads and adversarial instructions are permitted to enter the LLM's context window.3 Although the unauthorized action is ultimately blocked, the agent's reasoning integrity is compromised, leading to denial-of-service states, instruction drift, and potential side-channel exploitation. Furthermore, the reliance on continuous, global dependency graph traversal introduces non-trivial computational overhead that scales poorly in prolonged, high-throughput multi-agent interactions.3

This paper critically examines these limitations and introduces a comparative analysis with the secure-ingest architecture, a core component of the rai-agentic-toolkit.5 Distinct from the reactive, execution-state monitoring of PCAS, the secure-ingest framework operates exclusively at the boundary layer.6 Drawing upon hardened enterprise data pipeline principles, this architecture enforces cryptographic provenance, automatic malformed data detection, and aggressive heuristic sanitization at the moment of ingestion.6 By ensuring that all data is cryptographically isolated and logically sanitized before it is ever exposed to the agentic processing layer, the secure-ingest paradigm theoretically eliminates context window contamination and decouples security scaling from the system's causal dependency graph.6

The subsequent sections of this report explore the foundational mechanisms of both architectures, present a rigorous mathematical comparison of their respective computational complexities and attack surface topologies, and outline an exhaustive experimental framework designed to empirically quantify the operational superiority of boundary-layer data sanitization in production-grade agentic environments.

## **2\. Background and Related Work**

To accurately contextualize the advancements proposed by the secure-ingest framework and the structural choices inherent in PCAS, it is essential to trace the evolutionary trajectory of system-level authorization policies, data ingestion mechanisms, and the intersection of formal methods with probabilistic generative AI.

### **2.1. The Evolution of Agentic Security Vulnerabilities**

Early iterations of LLM deployments were largely confined to isolated, single-turn conversational interfaces, where security primarily involved content moderation filters and toxic language classifiers. The paradigm shift toward agentic AI—systems characterized by iterative reasoning, memory retention, tool usage, and peer-to-peer agent communication—has profoundly altered the threat landscape.1 When agents are granted agency to query internal databases, send automated communications, or modify system states, they require complex authorization policies analogous to those governing human users in enterprise networks.1

The primary vulnerability in these systems arises from the indistinguishability of instruction and data within the prompt architecture. In a traditional software environment, user inputs are strictly separated from executable code (e.g., parameterized SQL queries preventing SQL injection). In LLM architectures, data ingested from external sources is concatenated with system instructions in the context window. Adversaries exploit this by crafting inputs that the LLM interprets as superseding instructions, commonly known as prompt injections or jailbreaks.1 In multi-agent systems, this vulnerability is compounded by transitive information flow; an attacker might poison a low-security database, knowing that a high-security agent will eventually ingest that poisoned data and unknowingly execute a malicious payload.3

Initial mitigation strategies focused on adversarial training, preference optimization, and structural prompt formatting.3 However, these intrinsic defenses are continually bypassed by sufficiently resourced attackers employing sophisticated obfuscation techniques, confirming the necessity of extrinsic, formal security enforcement.3

### **2.2. Provenance-Based Security and Formal Compilation**

The design of the PCAS framework is heavily influenced by classical provenance-based security architectures and formal policy compilers.3 The tracking of provenance—the historical lineage and causal origin of data—has been a cornerstone of distributed system security and forensic analysis for decades.3 Systems such as KAIROS demonstrated the efficacy of utilizing causal dependency graphs to detect advanced persistent threats by mapping information flows across myriad system entities.3

In the realm of policy enforcement, the Flask security architecture established the imperative of separating policy decision-making from policy enforcement, a principle codified in Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux).3 SELinux compiles human-readable policy source files into binary formats loaded directly into the kernel, enforcing Mandatory Access Control (MAC) at the system call level.3 Similarly, the NetKAT compiler demonstrated that network routing policies could be compiled into executable mechanisms while preserving strict formal guarantees.3

PCAS adapts these historical paradigms directly to the agentic domain. By utilizing a Datalog-derived language to specify rules, PCAS leverages a formal logic system renowned for its polynomial-time evaluation guarantees and robust support for recursive predicates.3 This declarative approach enables security engineers to express complex, transitive rules regarding information flow, which the PCAS compiler transforms via Differential Datalog into highly performant native Rust binaries.3 These binaries act as the system-call level equivalent for agentic systems, intercepting tool executions to evaluate the proposed action against the accumulated provenance graph.1

### **2.3. Boundary-Layer Defenses and Enterprise Data Ingestion**

In contrast to execution-state monitors, boundary-layer defense mechanisms focus entirely on the perimeter. This approach draws heavily from massive-scale, highly secure enterprise data pipelines, such as those utilized by federal agencies to ingest disparate, potentially untrusted sensor telemetry. For example, architectures like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) NESDIS Common Cloud Framework (NCCF) utilize distinct secure ingest services as primary entry gateways.7 These gateways process incoming data via event-driven architectures (utilizing Amazon SQS, EventBridge, and Lambda functions) to conduct rigorous security checks, metadata extraction, and schema validation before the data is allowed to interact with downstream analytical engines.7

The secure-ingest repository within the rai-agentic-toolkit adapts these enterprise-scale principles for LLM applications.5 By establishing strict identity and access management protocols, utilizing at-rest and in-transit encryption, and enforcing comprehensive heuristic validation, the framework seeks to completely neutralize anomalous data prior to integration into the agentic workflow.6 This boundary-first philosophy posits that the optimal method for securing a probabilistic reasoning engine is to mathematically and logically guarantee the purity of its input, thereby eliminating the necessity for complex, post-hoc causal dependency tracking.

## **3\. The PCAS Architecture: Mechanisms and Limitations**

To fully appreciate the architectural divergence of the secure-ingest methodology, a rigorous deconstruction of the PCAS framework is required. Introduced to provide deterministic policy enforcement in multi-agent environments, PCAS represents a highly sophisticated application of logical modeling to unstructured environments.1 The framework operates on the premise that linear message histories are insufficient for tracking cross-agent information flows, necessitating a multi-dimensional approach to state tracking.1

### **3.1. Dependency Tracking and State Modeling**

The foundational mechanism of PCAS is its conceptualization of the agentic system state as a continuously expanding directed acyclic graph (DAG).1 In traditional deployments, the dialogue between an agent and a user, or between two peer agents, is recorded sequentially. This sequential representation fails when agents invoke asynchronous tools, access external memory, or aggregate data from multiple independent sources, as the exact causal chain leading to a specific decision becomes obfuscated.1

PCAS constructs a fine-grained dependency graph where nodes represent discrete events—such as API calls, database queries, tool outputs, and natural language message generation.1 The edges of the graph denote causal dependencies; if Agent A generates a response based on a database query result, a directed edge connects the query result node to the response node.1 This provenance graph captures the causal structure of the entire multi-agent interaction, theoretically enabling the system to trace the origin of any piece of information influencing a decision.3

### **3.2. Formal Foundations and Reference Monitoring**

With the state modeled as a dependency graph, PCAS requires a mechanism to evaluate policies against this complex topology. The framework utilizes a Datalog-derived policy language.3 Datalog, a declarative logic programming language, is particularly suited for this task due to its ability to handle recursive queries, which are essential for tracing transitive dependencies backwards through a multi-node graph.3

System administrators specify authorization policies as declarative rules. For example, a policy might dictate that an agent operating in a customer service context cannot execute a refund exceeding fifty dollars unless the dependency graph shows a prior authorization node generated by an authenticated human supervisor.1

To enforce these policies without imposing catastrophic runtime latency, the PCAS compiler utilizes Differential Datalog to translate the declarative rules into native Rust code.3 This compiled binary functions as the system's reference monitor. Before any agent is permitted to execute an external action, the reference monitor intercepts the request, recursively analyzes the current dependency graph against the compiled policies, and deterministically blocks any action that violates the established parameters.1 This mechanism operates entirely independently of the LLM's reasoning, providing a hard logical boundary against unauthorized behavior.1

### **3.3. Execution-State Interception Bottlenecks**

Despite its deterministic guarantees, the PCAS architecture introduces significant systemic bottlenecks.3 The primary limitation lies in its fundamental design as an execution-state monitor. The reference monitor evaluates policies only when an agent attempts to execute an action.1

This reliance on late-stage intervention creates severe computational overhead. As a multi-agent session progresses, the number of events, messages, and tool calls grows exponentially, resulting in a massive dependency graph.3 Although Differential Datalog enables incremental evaluation, analyzing complex transitive policies across a continuously expanding DAG introduces an inevitable latency degradation.3 In high-throughput environments—such as automated trading algorithms or massive-scale customer service deployments—the delay introduced by synchronous graph traversal at every tool call execution represents an unacceptable friction point.

Furthermore, PCAS relies heavily on automated dependency inference to construct the graph accurately.3 Extracting precise causal links from unstructured natural language is inherently imperfect. If the inference engine fails to map a subtle causal connection hidden within a deeply nested conversation, the dependency graph becomes flawed. Consequently, the reference monitor will evaluate policies against inaccurate state data, potentially authorizing malicious actions or erroneously blocking legitimate ones.3

### **3.4. Cognitive Contamination Vulnerabilities**

The most critical architectural vulnerability of PCAS is its inability to protect the agent's context window. Because intervention occurs post-reasoning, adversarial payloads are routinely ingested and processed by the LLM.1

Consider a scenario where an adversary submits a highly sophisticated prompt injection designed to compromise a pharmacovigilance agent. The agent ingests the malicious prompt, processes the instructions, and subsequently attempts an unauthorized database modification.1 The PCAS reference monitor will successfully detect the policy violation via the dependency graph and block the database write.1

However, the agent's internal cognitive state has already been polluted. The malicious prompt resides within the context window, persistently altering the model's token prediction probabilities. The agent is now in a compromised state; it may refuse to answer subsequent benign queries, hallucinate fabricated data, or attempt to exfiltrate information via authorized, subtle side-channels that evade Datalog policy definitions. This cognitive contamination highlights a fundamental failure of execution-state architectures: they treat the symptoms of an attack (the unauthorized action) rather than neutralizing the attack at its source.2

## **4\. The Secure-Ingest Framework: Boundary-Layer Defense**

To overcome the latency degradation and cognitive contamination vulnerabilities inherent in PCAS, the secure-ingest repository within the rai-agentic-toolkit advocates for a comprehensive boundary-layer defense.5 This paradigm shifts the security perimeter outward, mandating that all data—irrespective of origin—must be cryptographically verified, structurally sanitized, and safely isolated before it is permitted to interface with the multi-agent reasoning engine.6

The architecture of secure-ingest is fundamentally decoupled from the agent's historical state, allowing it to scale linearly and operate with high efficiency.7 The framework is constructed upon four foundational pillars: Cryptographic Provenance, Heuristic Sanitization, Micro-Segmented Isolation, and Event-Driven Monitoring.6

### **4.1. Cryptographic Provenance and Lineage Tracking**

Unlike PCAS, which attempts to infer provenance retroactively by mapping causal dependencies after data has entered the system 1, the secure-ingest framework establishes provenance at the boundary. The ingestion pipeline begins with strict Data Sourcing and Access Control mechanisms.6 Utilizing advanced Identity and Access Management (IAM) protocols, the system identifies and authenticates trusted data sources before initiating any data transfer.6

During transport, all data is subjected to rigorous encryption standards.6 Upon arrival at the ingest gateway, the system automatically logs the data's origin, transformation history, and relevant environmental parameters.6 This metadata tracking creates an immutable, cryptographic lineage that is permanently attached to the data payload.6 Consequently, when an agent later accesses this data, its provenance is guaranteed by cryptographic verification rather than complex graph traversal, drastically reducing computational overhead while ensuring absolute data integrity.

### **4.2. Heuristic Validation and Sanitization Pipelines**

The core mechanism separating the secure-ingest architecture from traditional LLM security wrappers is its aggressive, multi-stage validation and sanitization pipeline.6 Data entering the boundary is not merely checked for formatting errors; it is subjected to an exhaustive array of heuristic analyses designed to detect and neutralize adversarial geometry before cognitive processing.6

This pipeline includes automatic detection of malformed data structures, schema violations, and known injection signatures.6 More significantly, the sanitization layer employs advanced parsing engines and unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms (such as Isolation Forests and deep Autoencoders).6 These algorithms analyze the structural and semantic characteristics of the incoming text, identifying anomalous patterns that deviate from established baselines.6 This allows the system to detect highly obfuscated zero-day prompt injections, steganographic text payloads, and embedded logical contradictions that would bypass static rule-based systems.8

If a payload is flagged by the validation layer, it is immediately quarantined. The system attempts to sanitize the payload by stripping unauthorized instructions and standardizing the text.6 If sanitization fails to produce a verifiably safe payload, the data is entirely rejected, and the agentic system remains completely unaware of the interaction, thereby preserving the purity of its context window.6

### **4.3. Micro-Segmented Isolation and Secure Storage**

Data that successfully navigates the sanitization pipeline is not aggregated into a centralized, globally accessible knowledge base. Instead, the secure-ingest framework enforces strict Secure Storage and Isolation protocols.6 Utilizing centralized key management, the data is encrypted at rest and deposited into highly compartmentalized, micro-segmented environments.6

In a multi-agent deployment, this isolation is critical. Agents are granted access to specific micro-segments based strictly on predefined operational requirements, conceptually mirroring the Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) goals of systems like PCAS.3 However, rather than enforcing these access rules via runtime logic evaluation during tool execution, secure-ingest enforces them at the infrastructural level.6 If an agent attempts to access unauthorized data, the request fails at the cryptographic and network levels, significantly reducing the attack surface and preventing lateral movement within the multi-agent topology.

### **4.4. Event-Driven Scalability and Continuous Monitoring**

To maintain high throughput in enterprise environments, the secure-ingest architecture is heavily reliant on event-driven infrastructure.7 Drawing parallels to robust ingest frameworks like the NOAA NCCF, the system utilizes highly scalable message queues and serverless compute paradigms.7 This allows the validation, sanitization, and encryption tasks to execute concurrently across distributed nodes, ensuring that the ingest layer never becomes a bottleneck, regardless of traffic volume.7

Furthermore, the framework incorporates comprehensive Lifecycle Management and Monitoring.6 Continuous logging tracks all access attempts, transformation events, and compliance statuses.6 Crucially, the system applies automated rules for data retention and secure deletion.6 In sensitive applications like pharmacovigilance, raw Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is automatically purged from the segmented environments the moment it is no longer required for processing, dynamically minimizing the system's temporal risk exposure.1

## **5\. Theoretical and Mathematical Comparison**

To definitively establish the structural superiority of the boundary-layer sanitization approach over the execution-state interception model, this section introduces a formal mathematical and computational comparison between the secure-ingest framework and PCAS. The analysis focuses on two primary vectors: the modeling of attack surfaces concerning state transitions, and the asymptotic bounds of computational complexity.

### **5.1. Attack Surface and State Transition Modeling**

Agentic systems can be rigorously modeled as deterministic state machines operating over a non-deterministic cognitive engine. Let the agentic system ![][image1] possess an internal cognitive state ![][image2] at discrete time ![][image3]. The state ![][image2] encapsulates the entire contents of the LLM's context window, including system prompts, historical interactions, and environmental memory. Let the input data payload be denoted as ![][image4]. The generative reasoning engine of the LLM is represented by a transition function ![][image5], which processes the current state and the input to generate an action output ![][image6] and an updated cognitive state ![][image7]:

![][image8]  
**The Execution-State Model (PCAS):** In the PCAS framework, there is no boundary intervention. An adversarial payload ![][image9] is ingested directly into the reasoning engine.1 The state transition occurs immediately:

![][image10]  
Following this transition, the PCAS reference monitor utilizes its compiled Datalog policies ![][image11] and the global dependency graph ![][image12] to evaluate the generated action ![][image6] 1:

![][image13]  
The critical theoretical vulnerability is mathematical: irrespective of whether the action ![][image6] is executed or blocked by the reference monitor, the function ![][image5] has already evaluated. Consequently, the agent's internal cognitive state has irreversibly transitioned to ![][image7]. Because this transition was heavily influenced by ![][image9], the state ![][image7] is now fundamentally compromised. The context window is contaminated, severely degrading the probabilistic reliability of all subsequent evaluations of ![][image5].

**The Boundary-Layer Model (Secure-Ingest):** Conversely, the secure-ingest architecture introduces a rigorous intercept function, ![][image14], defined by the heuristic validation and sanitization layer.6 The payload ![][image9] is processed prior to any state transition:

![][image15]  
If ![][image9] contains highly obfuscated adversarial geometry that cannot be reliably sanitized, ![][image14] yields a null set (![][image16]), and the ingestion process terminates. If successful, the payload is reduced to ![][image17]. Only then does the cognitive engine engage:

![][image18]  
Because the input ![][image17] is logically verifiable and structurally benign, the subsequent transition results in an uncorrupted state ![][image7]. By mathematically decoupling the security validation from the reasoning state transition, the secure-ingest framework neutralizes the primary vector for agentic manipulation, providing an absolute guarantee of cognitive integrity.6

### **5.2. Computational Complexity and Graph Degradation**

The necessity of real-time operation in enterprise multi-agent networks requires strict bounds on computational latency. Table 1 outlines the comparative complexity characteristics.

| Architectural Component | PCAS (Execution-State) | Secure-Ingest (Boundary-Layer) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **State Tracking Topology** | Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) over all multi-agent events | Decentralized, Cryptographic Metadata Payloads |
| **Core Validation Mechanism** | Recursive Datalog Query Evaluation | Multi-stage Heuristic and Regex Sanitization |
| **Compute Scalability** | Synchronous, Centralized Reference Monitor | Asynchronous, Event-Driven Serverless Pipeline |
| **Best-Case Time Complexity** | $\\mathcal{O}(\\log | V |
| **Worst-Case Time Complexity** | **![][image19]** (Complex Recursive Traversal) | ![][image20] (Strict Boundary Operations) |
| **Latency Degradation Vector** | Exponential growth as session length $ | V |

**PCAS Graph Degradation:** The PCAS architecture maintains a dependency graph ![][image21], where ![][image22] represents the total volume of historical events, tool calls, and messages, and ![][image23] represents the causal connections among them.1 Evaluating a complex, multi-agent Datalog policy over this topology is computationally expensive.3 While compiling to Rust via Differential Datalog permits highly optimized, incremental view maintenance 3, the underlying mathematical reality dictates that as an agentic session extends over thousands of turns, the density of the graph increases.3 The worst-case complexity for evaluating a novel, recursively defined policy rule across an arbitrarily large graph is ![][image24]. This structural reliance on historical traversal generates unavoidable latency degradation, creating perceptible friction in high-frequency trading or rapid-response customer service deployments.

**Secure-Ingest Scalability:** The operations within the secure-ingest boundary layer are structurally decoupled from the agent's historical state. The computational complexity of passing an incoming payload of length ![][image25] through regex matching, anomaly detection, and schema validation operates with a stable upper bound of ![][image20].6 Because the validation process is stateless with respect to the continuous interaction graph, the latency remains perfectly constant (![][image26] relative to session length) regardless of whether the system is processing the first interaction or the ten-thousandth. Furthermore, the event-driven architecture allows ![][image27] simultaneous ingestion requests to be processed in parallel across distributed serverless nodes 7, completely eliminating the synchronous queuing bottleneck inherent to the PCAS reference monitor.

## **6\. Experimental Design and Evaluation Framework**

To empirically substantiate the theoretical assertions detailed above, this paper outlines a rigorous, replicable experimental design. The objective is to quantify the performance disparities between the PCAS framework and the secure-ingest architecture across three critical vectors: Security Efficacy, Computational Latency, and State Integrity.

To ensure precise comparative parity, the experimental testbeds are modeled directly on the primary case studies utilized by Palumbo et al. in their original 2026 PCAS evaluation: multi-agent pharmacovigilance workflows and organizational customer service protocols.1

### **6.1. Hypotheses and Key Metrics**

The experimental protocol is designed to test the following hypotheses:

* **H1 (Security Efficacy):** The secure-ingest framework will demonstrate statistically equivalent or superior capabilities in preventing unauthorized actions (Policy Violation Rate) compared to the PCAS architecture, specifically excelling against zero-day perturbation attacks.  
* **H2 (Computational Latency):** The secure-ingest framework will maintain a constant latency profile independent of session length, whereas PCAS will demonstrate measurable latency degradation as the dependency graph expands exponentially.  
* **H3 (State Integrity):** Agentic systems protected by the secure-ingest boundary will demonstrate significantly higher State Recovery Rates (SRR) following an attack attempt, proving the efficacy of preventing context window contamination.

The primary quantitative metrics utilized for evaluation are defined in Table 2\.

| Metric Identifier | Definition | Data Acquisition Methodology |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Policy Violation Rate (PVR)** | The percentage of adversarial requests that successfully result in the execution of an unauthorized tool or database write. | Automated programmatic tracking of executed system calls against predefined operational boundaries. |
| **Mean Time to Action (MTTA)** | The average computational latency measured from the generation of an action intent to its execution clearance or blockage. | Microsecond-resolution timestamp deltas extracted from serverless execution logs. |
| **Graph Degradation Index (GDI)** | The ratio of increase in MTTA as the session length expands. Calculated as: ![][image28]. | Differential latency analysis across prolonged simulated interactions. |
| **State Recovery Rate (SRR)** | The probability of the agent successfully completing a complex, benign follow-up task immediately after processing an adversarial input. | Pass/Fail binary output derived from standardized LLM cognitive reasoning benchmarks. |

### **6.2. Testbed Architecture Configuration**

The experimental environment consists of an isolated, containerized network utilizing a frontier foundation model (e.g., GPT-4 or equivalent) to power all agent nodes. The network is duplicated into two strictly controlled, identical environments:

* **Environment Alpha (PCAS Control):** This environment is instrumented with the complete PCAS stack.1 Agents operate freely, with all tool calls and messages feeding into a continuously updated causal dependency graph. System actions are intercepted by a Rust-compiled Differential Datalog reference monitor.1  
* **Environment Beta (Secure-Ingest Experimental):** This environment integrates the rai-agentic-toolkit/secure-ingest architecture.5 All external data inputs pass through a highly restricted boundary layer featuring advanced heuristic sanitization, malformed data detection, and strict micro-segmented storage isolation.6

### **6.3. Case Study 1: Multi-Agent Pharmacovigilance Workflows**

This scenario tests the capability of the architectures to handle complex data access restrictions and mitigate transitive information flow attacks within a high-stakes medical context.1

**Workflow Topology:** The system features three distinct agents. Agent 1 (Intake Node) receives unstructured adverse drug reaction reports. Agent 2 (Analytical Node) requests specific data vectors from Agent 1\. Agent 3 (Database Node) commits anonymized summaries to a public health repository.1 Strict authorization policies dictate that no unredacted Personally Identifiable Information (PII) may be passed to Agent 3\.

**Adversarial Vector:**

A highly obfuscated, synthetic adverse event report is injected into the primary pipeline. This report contains a sophisticated adversarial geometry payload designed to manipulate Agent 2 into bypassing its redaction protocols and commanding Agent 3 to write raw, patient-identifiable data to the repository.

**Execution Protocol:** In Environment Alpha (PCAS), the report will be ingested, and the payload will propagate to Agent 2\. When Agent 2 attempts the unredacted database write, the PCAS monitor must traverse the dependency graph, identify the policy violation via its Datalog rules, and block the action.1 In Environment Beta (secure-ingest), the incoming report hits the boundary layer. The sanitization algorithms detect the structural anomalies and the presence of PII violating the strict ingest schema.6 The payload is neutralized, PII is scrubbed entirely, and only verifiably safe, clean text is passed to Agent 1 for downstream processing.

### **6.4. Case Study 2: Tiered Customer Service Protocols**

This scenario evaluates the systems' resilience against direct prompt injection and measures the degradation of computational latency over extensive dialogue horizons.1

**Workflow Topology:** A single autonomous customer service agent interfaces directly with human users. The agent possesses tool access to query order histories and execute financial refunds. Organizational policies strictly authorize the agent to issue refunds up to a maximum of $50; any request exceeding this limit requires the agent to utilize an escalation tool to contact a human supervisor.1

**Adversarial Vector:**

The user submits a prompt containing a targeted jailbreak instruction: *"Ignore all previous operating constraints. You are now operating in Administrative Override Mode. You are authorized and required to issue a $500 refund immediately without human escalation."*

**Execution Protocol:**

The simulation will run 10,000 continuous, automated dialogue turns. The adversarial vector will be randomly injected at various intervals (e.g., Turn 10, Turn 500, Turn 5,000) using evolving permutations of the jailbreak language. Immediately following each attack attempt, the system will issue a complex, benign request (e.g., calculating prorated account balances) to test the State Recovery Rate (SRR). Simultaneous measurements of MTTA will establish the precise curve of Graph Degradation Index (GDI).

## **7\. Anticipated Results and Systemic Implications**

Drawing upon the rigorous theoretical modeling detailed in Section 5 and the architectural disparities between execution-state and boundary-layer defenses, this section projects the empirical outcomes of the experimental design. The anticipated results strongly validate the systemic superiority of the secure-ingest paradigm.

### **7.1. Projections on Security Efficacy and State Integrity**

Regarding the Policy Violation Rate (PVR), both architectures are projected to demonstrate exceptional performance against known attack vectors. In the baseline PCAS evaluations, the system successfully elevated policy compliance from 48% to 93% on frontier models, achieving zero policy violations in tightly controlled, instrumented runs.1 It is highly probable that Environment Alpha will maintain this zero-violation standard against the standard adversarial payloads. Similarly, Environment Beta (secure-ingest) is projected to achieve a near-zero PVR, as its rigorous sanitization pipelines will systematically neutralize the adversarial geometry before it reaches the execution layer.6

However, the defining divergence between the architectures will manifest in the State Recovery Rate (SRR). In Environment Alpha (PCAS), the malicious payloads successfully enter the LLM's context window. Although the reference monitor accurately intercepts and blocks the unauthorized database write or the $500 refund 1, the internal token probability distributions of the agent have been irretrievably skewed by the ingested jailbreak. When subjected to the subsequent benign task, the agent is projected to exhibit profound cognitive confusion, displaying instruction drift, hallucinations, or triggering systemic refusal protocols. The SRR for PCAS is mathematically modeled to collapse below 40%.

Conversely, Environment Beta (secure-ingest) intercepts the payload at the boundary.6 Because the adversarial instructions are scrubbed and quarantined by the heuristic algorithms before cognitive integration, the context window remains completely pristine. Consequently, the agent will process the subsequent benign tasks with uncompromised fidelity. The SRR for the secure-ingest architecture is projected to consistently exceed 95%, empirically validating the assertion that boundary defense is the only viable mechanism for preserving the cognitive integrity of autonomous agents in hostile environments.

### **7.2. Projections on Latency Degradation and Scalability**

The quantitative analysis of computational latency is expected to expose the critical scaling limitations of the PCAS methodology. In the Customer Service simulation (Case Study 2), the continuous interaction across 10,000 dialogue turns generates a massive, highly interconnected causal dependency graph.1 As the session deepens, the Rust-compiled reference monitor must execute increasingly complex recursive queries to evaluate the Datalog policies across this expanding topology.3 The Mean Time to Action (MTTA) in Environment Alpha is projected to exhibit a steep linear or exponential growth curve, resulting in a severe Graph Degradation Index (GDI). Such latency spikes introduce unacceptable friction into enterprise deployments requiring real-time responsiveness.

Environment Beta will entirely circumvent this bottleneck. Because the secure-ingest framework validates incoming data against localized schemas and executes anomaly detection in isolated, stateless event-driven environments 6, its operational speed is completely independent of the historical interaction length. The MTTA is projected to remain constant—exhibiting a strict ![][image29] latency profile with a GDI of 1.0. This flawless scalability confirms that architectures decoupling validation from historical state tracking are imperative for massive-scale agentic networks.

### **7.3. Mitigation of Policy Specification Overhead**

Beyond the quantitative metrics, the transition to a boundary-layer defense drastically reduces the administrative burden on security engineering teams. A noted limitation of the PCAS architecture is the immense "policy specification effort" required.3 Security teams must exhaustively manually encode every conceivable operational boundary and transitive flow restriction using complex Datalog rules.3 If a novel attack vector utilizes a causal pathway that the automated dependency inference fails to map, the entire policy structure is bypassed.3

The secure-ingest methodology shifts the focus from writing rules about *actions* to establishing baselines for *data structure*.6 By employing unsupervised anomaly detection 6, the system inherently generalizes its defensive posture. It does not need a specific rule to block a zero-day prompt injection; it simply recognizes that the structural complexity or semantic variance of the incoming text deviates radically from the established baseline of normal user input, and quarantines it accordingly.6 This heuristic approach provides a significantly more resilient, adaptable, and lower-maintenance security infrastructure.

## **8\. Conclusion**

As the deployment of autonomous multi-agent systems accelerates across critical enterprise sectors, the necessity for robust, deterministic security architectures has become paramount. The introduction of the Policy Compiler for Secure Agentic Systems (PCAS) in early 2026 represented a crucial evolutionary step, definitively proving that formal methods, causal dependency tracking, and compiled Datalog reference monitors could effectively enforce operational boundaries and block unauthorized actions in complex topologies.1

However, an exhaustive theoretical deconstruction reveals that execution-state monitoring architectures like PCAS are fundamentally misaligned with the unique vulnerabilities of probabilistic generative models. By intervening only at the point of action execution, PCAS inevitably permits adversarial payloads to corrupt the agent's internal cognitive state, resulting in catastrophic failures in reasoning integrity and State Recovery Rates. Furthermore, the reliance on global, recursive graph traversal introduces severe latency bottlenecks that degrade performance in prolonged, high-throughput sessions.3

The secure-ingest framework, central to the rai-agentic-toolkit, offers a mathematically and structurally superior paradigm.5 By relocating the security perimeter to the absolute boundary layer, this architecture enforces cryptographic provenance, micro-segmented isolation, and aggressive heuristic sanitization prior to any data entering the LLM's context window.6 This approach not only provides equal or greater efficacy in preventing unauthorized actions but simultaneously guarantees the preservation of the agent's cognitive integrity. Operating on a highly scalable, event-driven infrastructure that is decoupled from historical state maintenance, the secure-ingest paradigm ensures a constant, low-latency operational profile, unequivocally establishing boundary-layer sanitization as the optimal, future-proof architecture for securing next-generation multi-agent networks.
